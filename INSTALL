If you want to compile kueue, please run "mkdoc.sh" in the 
doc directory first, otherwise it won't build properly. 

Other than that, it's a straight-forward cmake process:

  # mkdir build
  # cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Usr
  # sudo make install

Dependencies:

  * LibArchive
  * Qt 4
  * Qt Sqlite
  * Qt WebKit

Have a lot of fun...
