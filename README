Shortcuts:

* CTRL-R / global / rebuild the database
  This is useful if the db got messed up for whatever reason, it will delete
  and rebuild the whole thing

* CTRL-N / global / test notification
  Send a test notification - mostly for development/testing/debugging

* F1-F4 / queue browser / filter
  F1: Show only awaiting support
  F2: Show only awaiting customer
  F3: Show all others
  F4: Show everything

* CTRL-L / unitybrowser / logout
  This will log you out of unity and relogin right away.
  Should never be required due to automation, but one never knows ;-)

* CTRL-E / unitybrowser / send email 
  If you are viewing an SR in unity you can send an email to the sr contact
  using the template set in the unity settings with one shortcut

* CTRL-S / unitybrowser / set solution suggested
  If you are viewing an SR in unity you can have kueue create a Solution Suggested
  activity.

Other handy stuff:

* If you have an SR number in your clipboard, you can middle-click somewhere in 
  a unity browser and it will navigate to that SR
